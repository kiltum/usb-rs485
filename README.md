# USB to RS-485 adapter

Here is a small board for my home development purposes.

- Able to download firmware through USB or ST-Link/V2 from discovery boards
- Can act as USB to rs-485 adapter
- Can act as USB/RS-485 thermometer
- Can show one digit (or break it to 8 leds) for some purposes.
- Can be powered from USB or from RS-485 bus.
